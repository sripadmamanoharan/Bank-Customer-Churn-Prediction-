# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to **predict customer churn** using logistic regression and visualize business insights using **Power BI**.

## Objective
- Identify customers likely to leave the bank.
- Provide business insights for customer retention strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Power BI**: dashboard for key churn indicators
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Logistic Regression**: for binary classification

##  Dataset
- **File**: `Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv`
- **Features**: Customer ID, age, balance, tenure, active status, etc.
- **Target**: `Exited` (1 = churned, 0 = retained)

##  Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Logistic Regression Model**
5. **Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC)**
6. **Dashboard Creation in Power BI**

## Sample Insights
- Customers with low balance and short tenure are more likely to churn.
- Active customers and those with higher credit score show lower churn rate.

## Power BI Dashboard
Key Metrics:
- Churn Rate by Age and Gender
- High-risk segments
- Branch-wise churn
